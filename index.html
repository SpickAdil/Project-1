    <h2>Intro to Dolphins</h2><br>
    <p>
        A dolphin is a common name used for some of the aquatic mammals in the cetacean clade Odontoceti, the toothed whales.
        Dolphins belong to the families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), along with the river dolphin families Platanistidae
        (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the New World river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and probably
        extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species named as dolphins.
        
        Dolphins range in size from the 1.7-metre-long (5 ft 7 in) and 50-kilogram (110-pound) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5 m (31
        ft) and 10-tonne (11-short-ton) orca. Various species of dolphins exhibit sexual dimorphism where the males are larger
        than females. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not quite as flexible
        as seals, they are faster; some dolphins can briefly travel at speeds of 29 kilometres per hour (18 mph) or leap about 9
        metres (30 ft). Dolphins use their conical teeth to capture fast-moving prey. They have well-developed hearing which is
        adapted for both air and water; it is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are
        well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold
        water.
        
        Dolphins are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the tropic zones, but some, such as the right whale
        dolphin, prefer colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few large-bodied dolphins, such as the
        orca, feed on large prey such as seals, sharks, and other dolphins. Male dolphins typically mate with multiple females
        every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months
        and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a
        relatively long period of time.
        
        Dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.
        
        Dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as Japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. Besides drive
        hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. Dolphins feature in various cultures
        worldwide, such as in art or folklore. Dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity within dolphinariums and trained to
        perform tricks; the most common dolphin species in captivity is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are around 60 orcas
        in captivity.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Etymology</h2><br>

        <p>
        The name is originally from Greek δελφίς (delphís), "dolphin", which was related to the Greek δελφύς (delphus), "womb".
        The animal's name can therefore be interpreted as meaning "a 'fish' with a womb". The name was transmitted via the Latin
        delphinus (the romanization of the later Greek δελφῖνος – delphinos), which in Medieval Latin became dolfinus and in Old
        French daulphin, which reintroduced the spelling ph into the word dolphin. The term mereswine ("sea pig") is also used.
        
        The term dolphin can be used to refer to most species in the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins) and the river dolphin
        families of Iniidae (South American river dolphins), Pontoporiidae (La Plata dolphin), Lipotidae (Yangtze river dolphin)
        and Platanistidae (Ganges river dolphin and Indus river dolphin). Meanwhile, the mahi-mahi fish is called the
        dolphinfish. In common usage, the term whale is used only for the larger cetacean species, while the smaller ones with a
        beaked or longer nose are considered dolphins. The name dolphin is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin,
        the most common and familiar species of dolphin. There are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales,
        collectively known as blackfish: the orca, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and
        the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae and qualify as dolphins.
        Although the terms dolphin and porpoise are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoise usually refers to the Phocoenidae
        family, which have a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth and differ in their behavior.
        
        A group of dolphins is called a school or a pod. Male dolphins are called bulls, females are called cows and young
        dolphins are called calves.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Evolution</h2><br>
        <p>
        Dolphins display convergent evolution with fish and aquatic reptiles.
        Dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates). They are related to
        the Indohyus, an extinct chevrotain-like ungulate, from which they split approximately 48 million years ago.
        
        The primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully
        aquatic by 5–10 million years later.
        
        Archaeoceti is a parvorder comprising ancient whales. These ancient whales are the predecessors of modern whales,
        stretching back to their first ancestor that spent their lives near (rarely in) the water. Likewise, the archaeocetes
        can be anywhere from near fully terrestrial, to semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, but what defines an archaeocete is the
        presence of visible legs or asymmetrical teeth. Their features became adapted for living in the marine environment.
        Major anatomical changes include the hearing set-up that channeled vibrations from the jaw to the earbone which occurred
        with Ambulocetus 49 million years ago, a streamlining of the body and the growth of flukes on the tail which occurred
        around 43 million years ago with Protocetus, the migration of the nasal openings toward the top of the cranium and the
        modification of the forelimbs into flippers which occurred with Basilosaurus 35 million years ago, and the shrinking and
        eventual disappearance of the hind limbs which took place with the first odontocetes and mysticetes 34 million years
        ago. The modern dolphin skeleton has two small, rod-shaped pelvic bones thought to be vestigial hind limbs. In October
        2006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in Japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which
        scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.
        
        Today, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that
        branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 million years ago. Around 40 million years ago, a common ancestor between
        the two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene
        two-and-a-half million years ago, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage: the two species of hippo.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Anatomy</h2><br>
        <p>
        Dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and
        bulbous heads. Dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack
        external ear flaps. Dolphins range in size from the 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in) long and 50 kg (110 lb) Maui's dolphin to the 9.5
        m (31 ft 2 in) and 10 t (11 short tons) orca. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other Cetartiodactyls. Several species
        have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males.
        
        Dolphins have conical teeth, as opposed to porpoises' spade-shaped teeth. These conical teeth are used to catch swift
        prey such as fish, squid or large mammals, such as seals.
        
        Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole, in an upward blast, which may be visible in cold air,
        followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. Dolphins have rather small, unidentifiable spouts.
        
        All dolphins have a thick layer of blubber, thickness varying on climate. This blubber can help with buoyancy,
        protection to some extent as predators would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for
        leaner times; the primary usage for blubber is insulation from the harsh climate. Calves, generally, are born with a
        thin layer of blubber, which develops at different paces depending on the habitat.
        
        Dolphins have a two-chambered or three-chambered stomach that is similar in cellular structure to that of terrestrial
        carnivores. They have fundic and pyloric chambers.
        
        Dolphins' reproductive organs are located inside the body, with genital slits on the ventral (belly) side. Males have
        two slits, one concealing the penis and one further behind for the anus. Females have one genital slit, housing the
        vagina and the anus, with a mammary slit on either side.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Integumentary system</h2><br>
        <p>
        The integumentary system is an organ system mostly consisting of skin, hair, nails and endocrine glands. The skin of
        dolphins is specialized to satisfy specific requirements, including protection, fat storage, heat regulation, and
        sensory perception. The skin of a dolphin is made up of two parts: the epidermis and the blubber, which consists of two
        layers including the dermis and subcutis.
        
        The dolphin's skin is known to have a smooth rubber texture and is without hair and glands, except mammary glands. At
        birth, a newborn dolphin has hairs lined up in a single band on both sides of the rostrum, which is their jaw, and
        usually has a total length of 16–17 cm. The epidermis is characterized by the lack of keratin and by a prominent
        intertwine of epidermal rete pegs and long dermal papillae. The epidermal rete pegs are the epithelial extensions that
        project into the underlying connective tissue in both skin and mucous membranes. The dermal papillae are finger-like
        projections that help adhesion between the epidermal and dermal layers, as well as providing a larger surface area to
        nourish the epidermal layer. The thickness of a dolphin's epidermis varies, depending on species and age.</p><br>
        
        <h2>Blubber</h2><br>
        <p>
        Blubber is found within the dermis and subcutis layer. The dermis blends gradually with the adipose layer, which is
        known as fat, because the fat may extend up to the epidermis border and collagen fiber bundles extend throughout the
        whole subcutaneous blubber which is fat found under the skin. The thickness of the subcutaneous blubber or fat depends
        on the dolphin's health, development, location, reproductive state, and how well it feeds. This fat is thickest on the
        dolphin's back and belly. Most of the dolphin's body fat is accumulated in a thick layer of blubber. Blubber differs
        from fat in that, in addition to fat cells, it contains a fibrous network of connective tissue.
        
        The blubber functions to streamline the body and to form specialized locomotor structures such as the dorsal fin,
        propulsive fluke blades and caudal keels. There are many nerve endings that resemble small, onion-like configurations
        that are present in the superficial portion of the dermis. Mechanoreceptors are found within the interlocks of the
        epidermis with dermal ridges. There are nerve fibers in the dermis that extend to the epidermis. These nerve endings are
        known to be highly proprioceptive, which explains sensory perception. Proprioception, which is also known as
        kinesthesia, is the body's ability to sense its location, movements and actions. Dolphins are sensitive to vibrations
        and small pressure changes. Blood vessels and nerve endings can be found within the dermis. There is a plexus of
        parallel running arteries and veins in the dorsal fin, fluke, and flippers. The blubber manipulates the blood vessels to
        help the dolphin stay warm. When the temperature drops, the blubber constricts the blood vessels to reduce blood flow in
        the dolphin. This allows the dolphin to spend less energy heating its own body, ultimately keeping the animal warmer
        without burning energy as quick. In order to release heat, the heat must pass the blubber layer. There are thermal
        windows that lack blubber, are not fully insulated and are somewhat thin and highly vascularized, including the dorsal
        fin, flukes, and flippers. These thermal windows are a good way for dolphins to get rid of excess heat if overheating.
        Additionally in order to conserve heat, dolphins use countercurrent heat exchange. Blood flows in different directions
        in order for heat to transfer across membranes. Heat from warm blood leaving the heart will heat up the cold blood that
        is headed back to the heart from the extremities, meaning that the heart always has warm blood and it decreases the heat
        lost to the water in those thermal windows.
